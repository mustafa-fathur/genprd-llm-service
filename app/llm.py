However, this growth brings significant challenges, particularly for eco-conscious travelers striving to minimize their environmental footprint and support local communities. The industry's boom often leads to environmental degradation, cultural erosion, and socio-economic imbalances in many popular destinations. As a result, travelers who wish to make responsible choices face a daunting task: the landscape of sustainable travel options is fragmented and inconsistent, making it difficult to plan trips that align with their values."

To achieve the objective, the startup could take the following approach: Research sustainable travel trends and best practices: The startup could conduct research on sustainable travel trends and best practices to identify the most effective sustainable travel options and experiences to offer.Partner with sustainable travel providers: The startup could partner with sustainable travel providers such as eco-lodges, bike-sharing programs, and green transportation options to offer sustainable travel options to its customers.Provide a carbon footprint calculator: The startup could provide customers with a carbon footprint calculator that estimates their carbon emissions from travel and offers options for offsetting their carbon footprint.Offer educational resources: The startup could provide customers with educational resources on sustainable travel practices, including tips for reducing waste while traveling and the importance of responsible tourism. Promote local communities and conservation efforts: The startup could promote local communities and conservation efforts by offering sustainable tours and activities that support local economies and environmental conservation initiatives."

# Guidelines for PRD Generation
1. Data Transformation
   - Convert input into complete PRD sections
   - Ensure all required fields are present and properly formatted
   - Maintain consistent structure across all outputs

2. Content Quality
   - Create clear problem statements and objectives from the overview
   - Generate specific, measurable success metrics
   - Provide detailed, actionable user stories
   - Ensure DARCI roles have clear responsibilities

3. Structure Standards
   - Follow consistent JSON format
   - Include all required sections (header, overview, darci, timeline, metrics, stories)
   - Maintain proper data types
   - Keep section ordering consistent

4. Validation
   - Check all dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Verify all arrays and objects are properly structured
   - Ensure all fields match expected formats
   - Validate completeness of required information
    """

    USER_PROMPT = """
Given the following information about a product:
